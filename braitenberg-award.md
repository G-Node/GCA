Valentino Braitenberg Award for Computational Neuroscience
==========================================================

The award is named after Prof. Dr. Valentino Braitenberg (1926, Bozen – 2011, Tübingen), one of the founding directors of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. With his novel research approach that combined anatomy, physiology, and theory, Valentino Braitenberg was a pioneer of the modern research discipline Computational Neuroscience and has significantly contributed to the development of biological cybernetics, which has in turn inspired robotics and artificial intelligence. On the occasion of her father’s 65th birthday, Carla Braitenberg, together with Max Gulin, created a Golden Neuron to be awarded in subsequent years as a challenge trophy for outstanding scientific achievements. Since 2012, this tradition has been continued in a modified form. With financial support of the “Autonome Provinz Bozen Südtirol” the Valentino Braitenberg Award is now biannually conferred within the framework of the Bernstein Conference. The 2014 Prize Giving Ceremony, including the talk of the Awardee Axel Borst (Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany), had to be rescheduled. It will take place during this year’s Bernstein Conference on Tuesday, September 15, 2015 at 9:20 a.m. The award will be presented by Ad Aertsen (Bernstein Center and University of Freiburg).
