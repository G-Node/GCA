Conceived in the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing security legislation, it paints an intimate picture of an unsettled society undermined by a silent epidemic of suspicion. Johannes, a new assistant at the university, is asked to provide reports on Farid, an Algerian Postdoc - who is suspected of being a sleeper. He refuses, but a seed of doubt has been planted. A fragile friendship overshadowed by competition in the lab and rivalry in their relationship with Beate, a joint friend, eventually leads to betrayal. \"My approach to the story was to interweave the political level in a delicate way with the characters\u2019 private conflicts in order to make the subtle corruption of the characters perceptible\" (B. Heisenberg, 2005).\nSchl\u00e4fer received numerous awards, among them the Midas Prize, EuroPAWS, for the best fiction drama set in science and technology, and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival 2005. The Cinema Bernstein screening of the film, open to the general public, will feature a discussion with artist, author and filmmaker Benjamin Heisenberg. Born 1974 in T\u00fcbingen, Heisenberg grew up near W\u00fcrzburg and studied sculpting (1993-1999) and filmmaking (1997-2005) in Munich. He has directed three feature films, numerous short films and is a founding editor of the filmmagazine Revolver. Most recently he co-designed the public artwork at the Munich Documentation Centre for the History of National Socialism.\n#### The Funder's Hour\nWednesday, September 13, 17:30 with Barbara Pauly (HFSP Director of Fellowships) and J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Barral (NYU, Long-Term Fellow)\nVenue: Central Lecture Hall (ZHG), first floor, room 105\nHFSP: Funding International Research Collaborations in the Life Sciences\n\nComputational and theoretical neuroscience can open up novel avenues towards understanding the nervous system by integrating methods and concepts of natural sciences, life science and engineering. This year\u2019s Bernstein Conference features The Funder\u2019s Hour to provide an exchange forum for funding agencies, which support such trans-disciplinary frontier research and the computational neuroscience community. The Funder\u2019s Hour 2017 will present the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP). HFSP has been supporting frontier research on the complex mechanisms of living organisms since 1990. HFSP Director of Fellowships Barbara Pauly will describe HFSP\u2019s funding aims and principles (HFSP: Funding International Research Collaborations in the Life Sciences). HFSP Long-Term Fellow J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Barral (NYU) will report about his HFSP experience and show some highlights of his HFSP funded research (Synaptic scaling to maintain neuronal dynamics and propagate information). The short presentations will be followed by a moderated questions and answers session.\n#### Public Lecture (in German)\nWednesday, September 13, 20:00\nVenue: Alte Mensa, Wilhelmsplatz 3, 37073 Goettingen\nNiels Birbaumer\nAbolishment of the locked-in state with a Brain-Machine-Interface (BMI)\nGehirn-Maschine-Verbindungen: Wem nutzen sie?\n\nCompletely locked-in patients (CLIS) cannot communicate with any motor response despite intact cognitive and emotional response systems. Four ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) patients in CLIS\u00a0 learned to respond with a brain oxygenation and deoxygenation change of frontal brain areas using portable NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy) to short questions requiring a yes or no response presented auditorily within 15 seconds. CLIS duration in the four patients has lasted from 4 months to eight years and was validated with EOG measurement during all sessions. Each session contained 20 to 60 questions (half with yes and half with no answers). All experiments take place at the home of patients. Questions with known answers were used to train a support vector machine classifier (SVM). After achieving 70% correct answers open questions were asked and feedback of the classified answer was provided to the patients. EEG from 6 electrodes served to control sleep and vigilance decrement: questions were interrupted if sleep-like patterns appeared. 16 to 60 sessions over several months assured stability of communication with an average correct response rate of more than 70% to known and 90% correct answers to open questions. Among open questions quality of life questions were asked on a weekly basis to three of the patients with longer CLIS duration, all patients report good quality of life as previously reported by our group. Open questions answers are validated by stability over time, information of family and care takers, sentences with semantic errors and face validity (i.e. pain questions during periods of intense pain due to decubitus and other illness related problems). These results suggest that brain machine interfaces using metabolic brain signals may end the unbearable silence of CLIS.\n\nSupported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),The Eva and Horst Koehler-Stiftung, Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung (BMBF, Motor-Bic), Stiftung Volkswagenwerk (VW), Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering, EU Horizon 2020: LUMINOUS. The lecture is brought to you with friendly support of the Otto Bock HealthCare GmbH.\n#### Brains for Brains Award 2017\nThe Brains for Brains Award is an initiative of the Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience. Since 2010, the Brains for Brains Award honors outstanding young international scientists who achieved a peer-reviewed scientific publication before starting their doctoral thesis. It consists of a travel fellowship of 2,000 \u20ac covering their trip to Germany, participation in the Bernstein Conference and two individually planned visits to selected Computational Neuroscience labs in Germany. The 2017 awardee will present a poster during the poster session on Thursday, September 14. This year\u2019s award will go to Elise Genevieve Rowe (Monash University, Melbourne, Australia). She will give a short talk during the award ceremony on Friday, September 15\n#### Bernstein Network Computational Neuroscience Information Booth\nThe Bernstein Network is a research network in the field of computational neuroscience; this field brings together experimental approaches in neurobiology with theoretical models and computer simulations. The network started in 2004 with a funding initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research to promote the transfer of theoretical insight into clinical and technical applications. Today, after 10 years of funding by the Federal Ministry, the Bernstein Network has over 200 research groups. It is named after the German physiologist and biophysicist Julius Bernstein (1839-1917). The Bernstein Network comprises three central facilities, which are represented at the information booth:\nBernstein Coordination Site (BCOS)\nBCOS is the connecting link to partners in science, industry, politics and the general public. It oversees a large information pool and can provide valuable networking resources.\nBCOS activities are aimed at facilitating scientific encounter, supporting young researchers and public outreach. The SMARTSTART Joint Training Program in Computational Neuroscience, which is coordinated by BCOS, prepares young researchers for a career in computational neuroscience. Information on all services can be gained during poster sessions.\n#### German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node)\nDuring the conference, the G-Node will present their new data management service GIN. GIN is a free service for managing, sharing, and publishing research data. It features versioned storage, multi-user access for collaboration, and publishing of data using persistent identifiers (DOI). The G-Node invites all conference participants to try out the new service: bring your data, discuss your data management needs, hear about upcoming features. Demos will be given during poster sessions and coffee breaks. Walk-ins are welcome any time during the conference.\n#### Bernstein Facility for Simulation and Database Technology (SimLab Neuroscience)\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC) can help your neuroscience projects. SimLab Neuroscience, at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre, provides advanced support in the fields of data analysis, modeling, simulation, HPC methods and visualization. It also offers tutorials, workshops, and courses to help you make the transition to HPC. Come and meet us at the booth and find out what the Bernstein Facilities can do for you.\n#### Further events at the Bernstein Network Information Booth:\nWednesday, September 13   15:30 BCOS Travel Grants: Award ceremony and group picture\n#### Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience\nThe Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience supports research and education in computational neuroscience and reaches out to the general public to bring across research topics and current findings. The Bernstein Association was founded in 2009 by members of the Bernstein Network and is recognized as a non-profit organization. Everyone who is active in the field of computational neuroscience or related subjects can become a member of the Bernstein Association.
