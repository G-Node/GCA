Special Events
==============
Bernstein Award for Computational Neuroscience 2013
---------------------------------------------------
Since 2006, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) annually confers the Bernstein Award for Computational Neuroscience to one excellent junior researcher with outstanding ideas for new research projects.
The award is endowed with up to 1.25 million € over the course of five years and is one of the most highly remunerated research awards for young scientists in Germany. With this funding, the awardees can establish their own, independent research group at a research institution of
their choice in Germany. 

The Bernstein Award will be conferred by Dr. Christiana Buchholz (BMBF) within the opening session of the Bernstein Conference 2013, on September 25, 2013. Following the award ceremony, the awardee will present his/her current research and future projects to be conducted with the support of the award.

Brains for Brains Awards 2013

The Brains for Brains Awards are an initiative of the Bernstein Association for Computational Neuroscience, supported by external donors. This year’s awards were kindly supported by Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, and Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH, Reutlingen. The Brains for Brains Award honors outstanding young international scientists who achieved a peer-reviewed scientific publication before starting their doctoral thesis. It consists of a 500 € cash prize and a travel fellowship of up to 2.000 € covering their trip to Germany, participation in the Bernstein Conference and two individually planned visits to selected Computational Neuroscience labs in Germany. The awardees will present a poster during the poster session on Wednesday, September 25. Additionally, they will give a short talk during the award ceremony on Friday, September 27. This year’s awards will go to Ralph Bourdoukan (École Normale Supérieure, Paris, France) and Marta Bisio (Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genova, Italy).
